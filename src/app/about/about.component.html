        Hi, I'm Sandipan, a passionate Full-Stack Developer with expertise in Spring Boot, REST API, and MySQL. I thrive
        on building scalable, efficient, and responsive applications that align with modern business needs. Currently,
        Iâ€™m expanding my skill set in Angular 19 to create dynamic and seamless user experiences.
        <br><br>
        With over two years of industry experience, I have successfully managed end-to-end web app development,
        translating complex business requirements into robust technical solutions. My proficiency spans both frontend
        and backend frameworks, ensuring optimal performance and functionality.
        
        Beyond coding, I enjoy strumming chords on my guitar and singing, adding creativity to both my music and
        development work. Always eager to learn, Iâ€™m also diving into low-level concepts and plan to explore Symbolic
        Machine Language (SMD) in the future.
        Currently pursuing my Masterâ€™s in Computer Applications (MCA), I am focused on refining my expertise and
        accelerating my professional growth. My portfolio showcases my journey, projects, and the innovations I bring to
        software development.
        <br><br>
        Letâ€™s build something amazing together! ðŸš€
